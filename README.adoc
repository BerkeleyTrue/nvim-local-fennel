Read my post, https://oli.me.uk/neovim-configuration-and-plugins-in-fennel-lisp/[Neovim configuration and plugins in Fennel (Lisp)], to get some more background on Aniseed.

Compile https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel[Fennel] to Lua for execution by Neovim upon editor startup with the help of https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed].

Add some Fennel code such as `(print "Hello, World!")` to a file named `.lnvim.fnl` in your current directory or anywhere above it such as your home directory. A file will be created beside the `.fnl` called `.lnvim.lua` which will be executed upon startup. Files higher up in your directory hierarchy, such as the home directory, will be executed before those found lower down, such as in a project.

Be sure to git ignore `.lnvim.fnl` _and_ `.lnvim.lua` if you don't want to share your local configuration with others. If you do want to share a `.lnvim.fnl` I'd recommend you ignore the `.lua` file to prevent duplicated changes in git commits.

Aniseed will only re-compile the Fennel code if it's changed since last time you opened Neovim. If you delete the `.lnvim.fnl` file then the `.lnvim.lua` file will be deleted automatically next time you launch Neovim to ensure you don't accidentally leave Lua files laying around.

== Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager, I highly recommend https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] if you don't have one already.

Pin the plugin to a tag then subscribe to new releases through GitHub. I'd hate to accidentally break your entire configuration through a bad release or breaking change. I follow https://semver.org/[semver], any breaking changes will incur a major version bump, breaking changes and upgrade steps will be listed in the release notes.

[source,viml]

No further steps are required, this plugin has zero configuration, it should _Just Work_â„¢.
